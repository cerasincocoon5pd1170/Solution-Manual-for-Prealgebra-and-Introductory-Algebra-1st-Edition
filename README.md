  * NEW! For the first time, the Miller/O'Neill/Hyde author team now offers a combined Prealgebra and Introductory Algebra text for those seeking to combine those topics into one volume! In addition, this text has aligned with a new online homework platform – Connect Math Hosted by ALEKS Corp. Based on a comprehensive market development process involving full-time and adjunct math faculty, Connect Math Hosted by ALEKS was built to excel in two areas: quality content and ease of use. A team of instructors and subject matter experts created the stepped out solutions for each algorithmic question, pulled from exercises in the text, to follow the exact methodology and language of the text in order to remain consistent across print and digital materials. The workflow is intuitive so that instructors can deliver assignments, quizzes, and tests easily online. Online study assets are specifically tied to the textbook. Connect Math Hosted by ALEKS also combines an online homework manager with an artificial-intelligent, diagnostic assessment to gauge the students’ current knowledge. With Connect Math Hosted by ALEKS Plus, students have 24/7 online access to an integrated, media-rich eBook. The Miller/O'Neill/Hyde author team continues to offer an enlightened approach grounded in the fundamentals of classroom experience in Prealgebra and Introductory Algebra 2e. The text reflects the compassion and insight of its experienced author team with features developed to address the specific needs of developmental level students. Throughout the text, the authors communicate to students the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, and this helps to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. Also included in this edition are Problem Recognition Exercises, designed to help students recognize which solution strategies are most appropriate for a given exercise. These types of exercises, along with the number of practice problems and group activities available, permit instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class as they do inside class with their instructor.
